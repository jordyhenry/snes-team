## Instructions

Use touch pan and touch rotation to place and ajust the target. Put your friend(s) in the middle of the marker and start record a video to trigger the animation. 

### Notes

* The original idea was using segmentation, so some of the characters could be behind or in front the user, enhancing the reality of the filter. But I decided to remove it to reach a large range of devices and increase the overall performance.
